## What Is This?
Freshman Year Project, **the codebase is messy and unclear**. As it was a speed learning project **from my early years**, didn't have time to implement what I designed.

But the functionalities work like a charm (See Checklist) and it was a learning experience.

## Project Overview
This is a **Simple Cinema Reservation System** where users can log in, sign up, and book seats for their choice of movies. Some users have discount privileges and control over the system.

## Additional Feature
After implementing the system, additional task was implementing extra feature.
I **implemented a security check**; asking credentials from admin, blocking the attempt after erroneous trials, when changing user privileges.
